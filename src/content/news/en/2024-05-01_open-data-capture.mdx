An essential component of the modernization of health care is measurement-based care (MBC). Much work has focused on approaches predicting outcomes and assigning treatments using measurements. However, one must first have measurements. In clinical settings, measurements are taken, but rarely considering future use of that data; no structure is imposed and no validation is implemented.

Here we present the design and implementation of the OpenDataCapture (ODC) platform at the Douglas Hospital. ODC approaches the MBC problem from the measurement side, providing a flexible infrastructure to collect and organize arbitrary longitudinal data from in-person and remote evaluations, encompassing a range of applications — from questionnaires to interactive memory tasks. ODC is designed with a robust security framework anonymizing personally identifying data with hash functions, and is built around tools powering the modern web. ODC implements a on-premises-first design for data storage and API, a single-page web frontend, and a pull-based encrypted cloud gateway for delivering instruments to clients outside an institution.
